Description: This package implements a simple linear regression function (lm_625) 
             in both base R and Rcpp. It provides coefficients, fitted values, residuals, 
             R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and F-statistics. The package also includes 
             testing and benchmarking to verify correctness and compare performance 
             between the R and Rcpp implementations.
